File Import: Loaded the dataset from Customers.csv into a DataFrame.

Null Check: Checked for missing values in the dataset using df.info() and df.isna().sum().

Column Cleanup:

Converted the dataset to a DataFrame (redundant if already in that format).

Dropped the unnecessary "Profession" column.

Feature Engineering: Added a new column "Age Group" by categorizing the "Age" column into bins (e.g., 'Under 18', '18-24', etc.).

Missing Values Handling: Removed rows with missing values in the "Season" column.

Duplicates Handling: Removed duplicate entries based on the "CustomerID" column.

Final Review: Performed a descriptive statistical summary using df.describe().
